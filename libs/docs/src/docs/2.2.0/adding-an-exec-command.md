title: Adding an exec command
description: Adding an exec command
---

Use the the `exec` command to automate the container actions.

1. Define attributes for the `exec` command to run using the default
    shell in the container.

    - A `commandLine` attribute that is a command to run.

    - A `component` attribute that specifies the container in which to
      run the command. The `component` attribute value must correspond
      to an existing container component name.

    ```yaml {% filename="devfile.yaml" %}
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    metadata:
      name: mydevfile
    projects:
      - name: my-go-project
        clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
        git:
          remotes:
            origin: 'https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git'
    components:
      - name: go-cli
        container:
          image: golang
          memoryLimit: 512Mi
          mountSources: true
          command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
          env:
            - name: GOPATH
              value: $(PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
            - name: GOCACHE
              value: /tmp/go-cache
    commands:
      - id: compile and run
        exec:
          component: go-cli
          commandLine: 'go get -d && go run main.go'
          workingDir: '${PROJECTS_ROOT}/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project'
    ```

    {% callout title="Note!" %}
    A command can have only one action, though you can use
    `composite` commands to run several commands either in sequence
    or in parallel.
    {% /callout %}

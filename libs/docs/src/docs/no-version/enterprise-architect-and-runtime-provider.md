## Define the standard way of working

Being the expert on language and framework, you can share the recommended workflow on developing applications based on different languages and frameworks.

## Build once, run anywhere

Develop the application stacks once, and they will work across different tools. There is no need to build and maintain custom support for each development tool.

## Easy sharing of workflows

By adding the stacks or samples that you have developed to a devfile registry, application developers can easily discover the devfiles that you provide. You can also provide starter projects or samples to showcase the usage of a specific runtime or framework.

## Governance

Add the necessary policy settings and compliance policies as part of the devfile to ensure anyone who uses the stack will follow the same workflow. By using the parent support in the devfile, any update on these policies, security fixes, and workflow will get picked up automatically to ensure consistency.

This guide will run through creating a simple hello world devfile project using Eclipse Che. The purpose of this guide is to provide a practical introduction to those just starting out with devfiles.

## Prerequisites

- Eclipse Che 7.65.x
- `kubectl` or `oc`
- Access to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster

## Procedure

1. Obtain access to Eclipse Che if you do not already have it, as an individual this can be done by setting up a [local instance of Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.dev/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-locally/)
    - You can use `minikube` to run your cluster locally, follow [these](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) steps to get started
    - An alternative is to use the [Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/ide), see 
    [the corresponding guide](https://www.eclipse.dev/che/docs/stable/hosted-che/hosted-che/) in Eclipse Che documentation if this method is used

2. For this quick start guide, we will create a simple [hello world Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) application

3. In Eclipse Che, create an empty workspace

4. Create the files which make up the simple [hello world Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) application
    
    ```json {% title="package.json file" filename="package.json" %}
    {
        "name": "helloworld-devfile",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "app.js",
        "type": "module",
        "dependencies": {
            "@types/express": "^4.17.17",
            "express": "^4.18.2"
        }
    }
    ```

    ```js {% title="Application source code" filename="app.js" %}
    import express from "express"

    const PORT = 3000
    const app = express()

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send("Hello world!")
    })

    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}..`)
    })
    ```

5. Create a devfile with the filename `.devfile.yaml`. The devfile should be populated with content similar to the following
    - The `schemaVersion` of the devfile can to set to the desired devfile specification version to use
        - It is recommended to use the latest release, currently `2.2.0`
    - The `metadata.name` field is the name of the workspace for the project

        ```yaml {% filename=".devfile.yaml" %}
        schemaVersion: <version>
        metadata:
          name: helloworld-example
        ```

6. Next, create the first component to serve as the dev environment for the project, for this use the [`container`](./devfile-schema#components-container) component with the name `dev-tooling` and the `quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:latest` image
    - `name` is the identifier used to refer to the component
    - `image` is the container image to use for the component, `quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image` is the default development tooling image used by Eclipse Che with multiple programming languages supports (including Node.js).

        ```diff {% filename=".devfile.yaml" %}
         schemaVersion: <version>
         metadata:
           name: helloworld-example
        +components:
        +  - name: dev-tooling
        +    container:
        +      image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest
        ```

7. The `dev-tooling` container will host the expressjs app which listens on port `3000`, define this port in the component by specifying an entry 
under [`endpoints`](./devfile-schema#components-container-endpoints)
    - Each endpoint has at least a `name` to identify them and the `targetPort` to specify the port number to forward

        ```diff {% filename=".devfile.yaml" %}
         schemaVersion: <version>
         metadata:
           name: helloworld-example
         components:
           - name: dev-tooling
             container:
               image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest
        +      endpoints:
        +        - name: http-3000
        +          targetPort: 3000
        ```

8. Now that the `dev-tooling` container is defined, [`commands`](./devfile-schema#commands) are useful to add in the IDE (the default is VS Code) some UI elements to guide developers during the development cycle. Define the command to install the dependencies needed to run the application (`npm install`)
    - The `id` field identifies the command so that it can be referenced in events or composite commands.
    - An [`exec`](./devfile-schema#commands-exec) command specifies explicit shell command(s) to run on a given `component`
    - `commandLine` defines the shell command(s) to execute as part of that devfile command
    - The `group` specifies what `kind` of command it is or if it is the default of its kind, `isDefault`

        ```yaml {% title="Install command" %}
        commands:
          - id: install
            exec:
              commandLine: npm install
              component: dev-tooling
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                isDefault: true
                kind: build
        ```

9. Next, define the command to run the application (`node app.js`)

    ```yaml {% title="Run command" %}
    commands:
      - id: run
        exec:
          commandLine: node app.js
          component: dev-tooling
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            isDefault: true
            kind: run
    ```

10. Now the devfile is ready to be used to run the application with Eclipse Che

    ```yaml {% title="Complete Workspace Devfile" filename=".devfile.yaml"  %}
    schemaVersion: <version>
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-example
    components:
      - name: dev-tooling
        container:
          image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest
          endpoints:
            - name: http-3000
              targetPort: 3000
    commands:
      - id: install
        exec:
          commandLine: npm install
          component: dev-tooling
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            isDefault: true
            kind: build
      - id: run
        exec:
          commandLine: node app.js
          component: dev-tooling
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            isDefault: true
            kind: run
    ```

11. Click 'Eclipse Che' in the bottom left corner, then select 'Eclipse Che: Restart Workspace from Local Devfile' to reload the workspace
with the new devfile

12. Once the workspace has finished restarting, run the `install` command by opening the menu, open 'Terminal/Run Task', under the 'Run Task' menu open 'devfile/devfile: install', the task should open
a terminal with the following

    ``` {% title="Output of running the 'install' command in Che" %}
     *  Executing task: devfile: install 


    added 67 packages, and audited 68 packages in 8s

    7 packages are looking for funding
      run `npm fund` for details

    found 0 vulnerabilities
    npm notice 
    npm notice New major version of npm available! 8.3.1 -> 9.6.5

    npm notice Run npm install -g npm@9.6.5 to update!
    npm notice 
     *  Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it. 
    ```

13. Run the application with the `run` command by going through the same steps as `install` but under the 'Run Task' menu open 'devfile/devfile: run', the task should open
    - The `run` command will execute until the user interrupts it, such as killing it with *Ctrl-C*

    ``` {% title="Output of running the 'run' command in Che" %}
     *  Executing task: devfile: run 

    Listening on port 3000..
    ```

14. Under the 'EXPLORER', expand the 'ENDPOINTS' panel and copy the `http-3000` endpoint URL

15. Paste the endpoint URL in a new tab and the response should just show "Hello World!"

16. (Optional) Normally when creating a workspace it is recommended to use a sample under 'Select a Sample' from the embedded devfile registry to 
start your project, a similar devfile project workspace can be created using the 'Node.js Express Web Application' sample

17. Congratulations! You have written your first devfile project with Eclipse Che!

description: What is a devfile

`devfile.yaml` describes how to configure and run build environment for
your project in a development container. You can create devfile from scratch or
adopt existing from [public community registry](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer).

Certain build tools and IDEs can automatically process the devfile
to configure, build, and run an application from a development project.

Using devfile, the tools and IDE can:

- Take in the repository hosting your application source code.

- Build your code.

- Run your application on your local container.

- Deploy your application to cloud-native containers.

You can use devfiles to automate and simplify your development process
by adopting the existing devfiles that are available in the [public community registry](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer)
or by authoring your own devfiles to record custom instructions to 
configure and run your build environment as a YAML-formatted text file.
You can make these devfiles available in the supporting build tools and 
IDEs that can automatically process the devfile instructions to configure 
and build a running application from a development project.

Using the recommended best practices from the devfile, the tools and IDE
can:

- Take in the repository hosting your application source code.

- Build your code.

- Run your application on your local container.

- Deploy your application to cloud-native containers.

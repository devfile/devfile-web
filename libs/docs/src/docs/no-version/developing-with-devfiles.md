A devfile is a `yaml` file. After you include it in your local
environment, the devfile provides ways to automate your processes. Tools
like `odo` run the devfile and apply its guidelines to your environment.
You can configure the devfile based on your unique development needs.

To get a better understanding of what devfiles can help build, take a look at a few tools that currently support devfile.

## Quick start guides

- Use the devfile specification to develop a Node.js “Hello World”
application using `odo`. Developing this application introduces you to how a devfile
automates and simplifies your development process.
    - [Quick start with odo v3](./quickstart-odo)
    - Get started with [odo](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/quickstart/nodejs).
- Create a workspace in `Eclipse Che` with a community sample backed by the devfile specification to start building your application in the language of your choice.
    - [Quick start with Eclipse Che](./quickstart-che)
    - Get started with [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.dev/che/).
- Use blueprints in `Amazon CodeCatalyst` to quickly build a "Modern three-tier web application". Start working on the source code with a Dev Environment that uses a devfile to pre-determine and install the required project tools and application libraries.
    - Get started with [Amazon CodeCatalyst](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/getting-started-template-project.html).
- Set up a remote development environment that links to your Git repository using `JetBrains Space Cloud Dev` and the devfile specification.
    - Get started with [JetBrains Space Cloud Dev Environments](https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2022/10/26/get-started-with-space-dev-environments/).

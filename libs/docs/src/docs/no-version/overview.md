A devfile is a `yaml` file. After you include it in your local
environment, the devfile provides ways to automate your processes. Tools
like `odo` run the devfile and apply its guidelines to your environment.
You can configure the devfile based on your unique development needs.
See the following documents to help you use a devfile based on your
development needs:

- [Adding schema version](./versions)

- [Adding a name](./metadata)

- [Adding projects](./adding-projects)

- [Adding commands](./adding-commands)

- [Adding components](./adding-components)

- [Defining variables](./defining-variables)

- [Defining attributes](./defining-attributes)

- [Referring to a parent devfile in a devfile](./referring-to-a-parent-devfile)

## Why devfiles?

With devfiles, you can make workspaces composed of multiple containers.
In these containers, you can create any number of identical workspaces
from the same devfile. If you create multiple workspaces, you can share
your devfile with different teams. By sharing a single devfile across
multiple teams, you can ensure that each team has the same user
experience and build, run, deploy behaviors.

Devfiles include the following features:

- Guidance for using runtime images

- Example code

- Build and CI commands

- Deployment options

Devfiles have the following benefits:

- Reduce the gap between development and deployment

- Find available devfile stacks or samples in a devfile registry

- Produce consistent build and run behaviors

The [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) provides validation, document outlining, auto-completion, hover support, and formatting for YAML files. To provide IntelliSense for devfiles, the YAML Language Server pulls all available schemas from the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). The devfile team maintains the devfile JSON Schema stored within the JSON Schema Store.

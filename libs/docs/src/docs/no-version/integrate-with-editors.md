The [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) provides validation, document outlining, auto completion, hover support, and formatting for YAML files. To provide intellisense for YAML files, or more specifically devfiles, the YAML Language Server pulls all available schemas from the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). The JSON Schema Store contains the devfile JSON Schema, which is maintained by the devfile team.
